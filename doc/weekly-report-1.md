# Weekly report 1

## What did I do this week?

This week, my plan is only to choose a topic for my project and set up the repo as per week 1 requirements.

## What progress did I make?

Only setting up the repo and checking that all requirements for week 1 are met.

## How is the program progressing?

No progress yet on the actual program. This week I just made everything ready so I can get started with actual coding as soon as possible.

## What did I learn this week?

The majority of the learning will come later when actual implementation begins.

## What was unclear or has been challenging?

No major obstacles, but I think there's quite a lot of material to go through to make sure that I'm not missing anything. Considering the first week's goals are just to get the project set up with some documentation, writing a report about it seems a bit unnecessary. 

## What am I doing next?

Finalize the project structure according to OT course, and then start working on the core functionality of the program. The plan is to get as much functionality done during next week, so that it's already possible to see which ideas work and which don't.
