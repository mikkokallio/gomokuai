# Weekly report 5

## What did I do this week? How is the program progressing?

I added some tooling for performance testing and started writing about some observations on how well (and fast) different versions of the AI play.

I peer reviewed another student's repo and got some comments on mine. For some reason, refactoring the name of a file had not replicated to the repo (despite successfull pushing & pulling), which had caused problems. I had to fix that manually in GitHub because git didn't for some reason work otherwise.

I also added a GitHub Action for automated testing. Currently it reports in the repo whether the latest version passed.

## What am I doing next?

I might automate some other things to run with the Github Action. It's probably also time to make some more improvements to the AI's algorithm since I've focused mostly on other things in the last 2 weeks.

## How many hours did I spend?

Probably around 15 hours.
