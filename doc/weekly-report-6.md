# Weekly report 6

## What did I do this week? How is the program progressing?

I didn't have much time for developing the program this week. Mostly time spend on the project went into reading articles and peer reviewing.
## What am I doing next?

I might automate some other things to run with the Github Action. It's probably also time to make some more improvements to the AI's algorithm since I've focused mostly on other things in the last 2 weeks.

## How many hours did I spend?

Probably around 5 hours.
