# Weekly report 4

## What did I do this week? How is the program progressing?

This week I didn't change much in the algorithm itself. Rather, I did performance testing on the existing functionality, trying to get statistical evidence about which features make the best AI players, assuming that the time given to each player is roughly the same.

I also changed the structure of the app (separating `index.py` and `app.py`) so that it's easier to unit test and parametrize the app. I also improved how the program outputs results so that they're easier to use for performance testing purposes.

## What am I doing next?

I'll be adding statistics about performance testing during next week. Also continuing to make the program easier to run and test. I'll also consider adding some new ways to make the AI smarter or faster.

## How many hours did I spend?

Probably around 25 hours.
