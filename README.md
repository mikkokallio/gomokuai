## Game rules

The AI players must follow the following rules:

* The game board size is 15 x 15.
* Two players take turns to place stones on the board.
* The first 3 moves are restricted: 1st is at the center of the board, 2nd is within the center 5 x 5 positions, and 3rd is outside the center 5 x 5.
* The player to get 5 stones in a row wins. These may be positioned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* If there is no winner after 60 turns, the game ends as a draw.
